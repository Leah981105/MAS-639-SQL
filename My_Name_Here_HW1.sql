You should be VERY VERY comfortable with each of these statements:
	 SELECT - defines the columns you want in your final table
     FROM - what table(s) are you using
     WHERE - subset or filter data for rows that meet one or more conditions
     GROUP BY - determines level of aggregation, or what each row represents
     HAVING - subset groups (if used, must appear after the GROUP BY statement), similar to WHERE but for groups instead of individuals observations
     ORDER BY

-- 31. Clue #1: We recently got word that someone fitting Carmen Sandiego's description has been
	-- traveling through Southern Europe. She's most likely traveling someplace where she won't be noticed,
	-- so find the least populated country in Southern Europe, and we'll start looking for her there.
select
	Name, 
    Population
from country
where Region = 'Southern Europe'
order by Population
limit 1; # country is Holy See (Vatican City State)



-- 32. Clue #2: Now that we're here, we have insight that Carmen was seen attending language classes in
	-- this country's officially recognized language. Check our databases and find out what language is
	-- spoken in this country, so we can call in a translator to work with you.
select
	Language,
    Isofficial
from language as l
inner join country as co on co.Code = l.CountryCode
where l.Isofficial = 'T' and co.Name = 'Holy See (Vatican City State)';  # Italian



-- 33. Clue #3: We have new news on the classes Carmen attended â€“ our gumshoes tell us she's moved on
	-- to a different country, a country where people speak only the language she was learning. Find out which
	-- nearby country speaks nothing but that language.
select
	co.Name,
    co.Code,
    l.Isofficial,
    count(l.Language) as lang_spoken

where co.Region = 'Southern Europe'
group by co.Name
having count(l.Language) = 1;

# the only nearby city that speak only italian is San Marino, Code:SMR





-- 34. Clue #4: We're booking the first flight out â€“ maybe we've actually got a chance to catch her this time.
	-- There are only two cities she could be flying to in the country. One is named the same as the country â€“ that
	-- would be too obvious. We're following our gut on this one; find out what other city in that country she might
	-- be flying to.

select 
	Name
from city 
where CountryCode = 'SMR';  # city name is Serravalle
					




-- 35. Clue #5: Oh no, she pulled a switch â€“ there are two cities with very similar names, but in totally different
	-- parts of the globe! She's headed to South America as we speak; go find a city whose name is like the one we were
	-- headed to, but doesn't end the same. Find out the city, and do another search for what country it's in. Hurry!

select
	ci.Name,
    co.Region,
    co.Code
from country as co
left join city as ci on ci.CountryCode = co.Code
where (co.Region = 'South America') and (ci.Name like 'Se%');  # city is Serra, in BRA

    


-- 36. Clue #6: We're close! Our South American agent says she just got a taxi at the airport, and is headed towards
	-- the capital! Look up the country's capital, and get there pronto! Send us the name of where you're headed and we'll
	-- follow right behind you!

	Name,
    CountryCode
from city 
where ID = (
				select
					Capital
				from country
                where Code = 'BRA'
			);   # capital in BRA is BrasÃƒÂ­lia




-- 37. Clue #7: She knows we're on to her â€“ her taxi dropped her off at the international airport, and she beat us to
	-- the boarding gates. We have one chance to catch her, we just have to know where she's heading and beat her to the
	-- landing dock.
    
    
    
    
    

-- 38. Clue #8: Lucky for us, she's getting confident. She left us a note, and I'm sure she thinks she's very clever, but
	-- if we can crack it, we can finally put her where she belongs â€“ behind bars.

-- Our playdate of late has been unusually fun â€“
-- As an agent, I'll say, you've been a joy to outrun.
-- And while the food here is great, and the people â€“ so nice!
-- I need a little more sunshine with my slice of life.
-- So I'm off to add one to the population I find
-- In a city of ninety-one thousand and now, eighty five.


-- We're counting on you, gumshoe. Find out where she's headed, send us the info, and we'll be sure to meet her at the gates with bells on.
